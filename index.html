                        <p>I. Property Preservation Matrix
                            As indicated in the Fannie Mae Single-Family Servicing Guide, Part VIII, Chapter 1, Section
                            106,
                            throughout the foreclosure process the servicer is responsible for performing all property
                            maintenance
                            functions to ensure that the condition and appearance of the property are maintained
                            satisfactorily.
                            Servicers should refer to the Fannie Mae Property Preservation Matrix below for property
                            preservation
                            allowable reimbursement amounts. Where the cost of the contemplated preservation work
                            exceeds
                            these amounts, the request will be submitted via HomeTracker. All pertinent supporting
                            information
                            and documentation that would assist Fannie Mae in making a sound and complete property
                            preservation decision should be included. Photos should be submitted as attachments to each
                            applicable line item. This Property Preservation Matrix supplements, but does not replace,
                            the guidance
                            contained in Part VIII, Section 106 of the Servicing Guide.
                            If the Servicer has not acquired access to Hometracker, the Fannie Mae Request for Repair
                            Form 1095
                            in excel format should be completed manually and submitted with supporting photo
                            documentation via
                            email to property_preservation@fanniemae.com.
